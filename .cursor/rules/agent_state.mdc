- The main, overall state for the agent should be defined in `src/state.py`.
- State for sub-agents should be defined in their individual `src/agents/{agent_name}/state.py`
- The API for agents should be clearly defined by Input and Output states that only expose elements of the agents state that are intended as part of its public API.
- The internal state for the agent should subclass the Input and Output state and define any additional internal state needed by the agent.
