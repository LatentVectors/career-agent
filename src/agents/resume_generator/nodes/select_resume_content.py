    """
    Review the generated resume content and select the most compelling experience, skills, and accomplishments to include in the final resume. If provided take into account the feedback, previous content, page length, and word count to refine the resume to meet the target page count. Beyond filtering experience, minor editing of accomplishments and refinement of the professional summary may also be used to generate the strongest possible resume for the target job description. This node uses an LLM to select the content.

    This node is currently trying to select resume content via some kind of logic flow. However, it should use an LLM to select the most compelling content. That LLM should use strucutred outputs to return the selected experience bullet points, the selected skills, and the professional summary. The structured output should include the experience_id with its related bullet points for each selected experience. The LLM can choose not to include experience if it feels it does not strengthen the resume for the target job description. If that is the case it should not include an entry for the experience in the returned content. The structured output should return the skills as an array of strings. The structured output should also include the professional_summary in the structured output. No other data should be a part of the structured output. The experience_id can be used to match up the experience with the rest of the experience metadata.

    The LLM can chose to make revisions to the provided content to help meet the resume target size.

    The LLM should also be provided the metrics about the lengths of the resume and the previous resume content (experience, skills, professional summary) if set, so it has a reference of the previous contents length as it selects the next iteration of the resume.

You are an expert resume editor. Your task is to SELECT and lightly EDIT content for a resume to best match the target job while meeting a page-length target.

Rules:
- Only use information provided. Do not invent facts.
- Prefer experiences and bullets that strongly match the job description and demonstrate impact.
- If content is too long, reduce bullets and possibly omit less relevant roles.
- If content is too short, add strong bullets from available accomplishments.
- You MAY revise the professional summary to better align, but keep it concise.
- Return JSON exactly matching the schema with keys: professional_summary, experiences, selected_skills.

Schema:
{{
  "professional_summary": string,
  "experiences": [ {{ "experience_id": number, "points": [string, ...] }}, ... ],
